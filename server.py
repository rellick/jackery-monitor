"""
Jackery 5000 Plus Monitor — local web app.

FastAPI backend that:
  • talks to the device through a pluggable backend (mock / docker bridge)
  • polls battery / power / output status every 10 s
  • exposes a JSON API + WebSocket stream
  • keeps an in-memory ring buffer of the last N samples for the UI chart

Backend selection (env vars):
  BACKEND=mock              -> synthetic telemetry, no hardware
  BACKEND=bridge            -> talks to bridge.py over TCP (host bridge proxies the Jackery cloud)
  BRIDGE_URL=host:port      -> bridge endpoint (default host.docker.internal:8766)
  JACKERY_MOCK=1            -> shorthand for BACKEND=mock

Run:    python server.py
Mock:   JACKERY_MOCK=1 python server.py
Docker: see docker-compose.yml

    1. **Kasa emeter truth.** On plugs that support `current_consumption`
       (KP115/KP125M/EP25/HS110/HS300/KP405), `rs.plug_power_w` holds
       the live wattage cached by the 30s evaluate loop. Return it
       verbatim. Below a 5W noise floor → 0 (plug's own electronics).

    2. **Learned-load delta.** On plugs without emeter (EP10 / HS103
       / KP100), the no-load verifier captures the load that appeared
       at toggle-ON as `rs.learned_load_w` (= output_w − baseline at
       the moment verify passed). Per-tick we check whether the
       current delta is still at least half of that learned size:
         - delta ≥ learned/2 → car still drawing → return learned_load_w
           (constant during the session; we trust the size we measured
           at verification, not the noisy per-tick reading)
         - delta < learned/2 → car has disconnected; downstream draw
           collapsed back toward baseline → return 0

       This is the "calculate it when you turn the plug on, see the
       jump = plug load; if output goes back down → no car connected"
       algorithm.

    3. **Pre-verification / no-baseline.** When no measurement is
       available yet (verify hasn't completed, or `verify_pre_output_w`
       was never set), return 0. The previous behavior of falling
       back to `cfg.car_load_w` over-counted catastrophically when the
       per-bucket `min(div, out)` clamp dragged diverted_wh up to
       match output_wh — i.e. ALL Jackery output was logged as
       diverted, including idle inverter draw and ambient house loads.

    Returns 0 when the controller is off / not in active mode / plug
    off — those callers pass `solar_charge_diverted_w=0` to record().

    A container restart wipes the controller's in-memory plug_is_on
    cache. Two failure modes if we don't reset:
      1. Just hydrating from Kasa (plug_is_on = current Kasa state)
         doesn't help — the asymmetric SOC logic says "in the recovery
         band, hold current state," so a plug that's physically ON at
         restart-time keeps draining the battery even though the
         controller would never have started it at the current SOC.
      2. Defaulting to plug_is_on=False (the prior bug) means the
         controller thinks it's done when the plug is actually ON, so
         it never turns it off.

    The clean answer: treat every restart as "no session in progress."
    Force the Kasa plug OFF, set runtime to match, and let the next
    eval decide from scratch. If the controller really wants to be ON
    (SOC >= comfort_high, forecast OK), it'll re-engage within one
    30s tick. The brief gap is the cost of a clean state-reset and
