"""
Per-browser device-view selection.

`serialize_status(view_device_id=...)` should:
  - default to the bridge-active device (existing behavior) when the
    cookie is missing, empty, points at the bridge-active device, or
    points at an unknown device on the account
  - synthesize a status payload for any *other* known device, pulling
    its telemetry from `cloud_meta.devices_telemetry[sn]`, its packs
    from `state.battery_packs_by_sn[sn]`, and its energy totals from
    the energy DB
  - override `cloud.selected_device_id` with the view's id so the
    frontend's `activeJackeryDevice()` follows the per-browser pick

The bridge keeps polling every device on every tick, so the synthesized
view is always current — picking a non-bridge-active device is purely a
UI render decision.
